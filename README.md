### Database System Course Design
### Introduction
This system is an innovative automotive parts sales management tool that incorporates the latest LLM (DB-GPT) technology for knowledge-based Q&A, providing an unprecedented user experience and management efficiency. Below are the main features, architecture, and installation guide of the system.

### Features
- Modular Design: The system uses a highly decoupled modular design, with a special emphasis on supporting the sales department. This flexibility allows the system to be quickly iterated and optimized for specific needs, while simplifying the user interface and reducing the learning curve.

- Advanced Data Analysis: Integrates advanced open-source technologies such as Python and Pandas to provide complex sales data analysis capabilities. This is particularly important for sales forecasting and decision support.

- Automated Reporting: The system includes an automated reporting feature that generates intuitive reports based on sales data, helping users quickly understand market dynamics and business performance.

### Architecture
- Front-end built with Vue framework to ensure rapid response and dynamic user interfaces.
<!-- Front-end code reference stu_manage_front project. -->
- Built with MySQL database for storage.

- Combines modern LLM technology with DB-GPT, providing efficient and intelligent data storage and retrieval capabilities.

- Uses pymysql to connect to the database.

- Complete requirement analysis and conceptual, logical structure design.

- Data Integrity: Our database strictly adheres to data integrity principles, including entity integrity, referential integrity, and user-defined integrity.

- Security Assurance: Security is a top priority in our design. The database employs multiple layers of security measures, including access control, encryption technologies, and regular backups.
